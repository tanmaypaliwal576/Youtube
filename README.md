This project is a high-fidelity, responsive front-end clone of the YouTube homepage, built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It focuses on accurately recreating the modern dark-theme UI, including the collapsible navigation sidebar, dynamic video grid, and interactive profile dropdown. While it is a front-end-only project, all navigation links are functional, making it a fully interactive UI demonstration.
